1. WAP in Python to add two numbers entered through keyboard by using a suitable user defined
function (say SUM) for addition operation.
2. WAP in Python to find the factorial of a number n by using a suitable user defined function (say fact)
for it.
3. WAP in Python to find out the sum of digits of a number n by suing function.
4. A Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first and second terms in the sequence are 0 and 1.
Subsequent terms are found by adding the preceding two terms in the sequence (Fi=Fi-1+Fi-2). WAP to
find out the value of nth term of the Fibonacci sequence by writing a suitable user defined function (say
fib) for it.
5. WAP in Python to swap the values of two variables by using a suitable user defined function (say
SWAP) for it.
6. WAP in Python to calculate GCD/HCF of two numbers by using a iterative function for GCD.
7. WAP in Python to test whether a number n is palindrome number or not.
8. WAP in Python to calculate x y by writing a function (say POWER) for it.
